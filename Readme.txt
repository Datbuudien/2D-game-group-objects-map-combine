Hello everyone! This is a small piece of code I wrote about merging objects drawn by a repeating character pattern. For example, in the string "1111111111111," we have 13 characters '1' that repeat and are drawn next to each other (for instance, each character corresponds to a 16x16 square drawn at consecutive coordinates). If the data is large enough, this can become wasteful because there may be too many objects. I've been thinking about merging all objects that share a segment of repeating characters! My code may not be optimal yet, and I would love to hear everyone's feedback.
